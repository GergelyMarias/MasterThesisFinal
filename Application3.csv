Before, I was confident in Stride's accuracy in reading my hard-worked miles. I don't know when the tracking app has been so inaccurate, but it is not the app we have to trust for our business-deductible expenses. I have used my Stride annual statement for tax purposes for the last three years. Any inaccurate underestimated miles lead to an underestimated business deduction.;

If this happens again, you can add a manual mileage entry - but of course, we would all rather have the tracker work without having issues in the first place.

It says it tracks miles and it does, sort of..... If you dont write down the miles at the end of the week the thing just shows what the monitary deduction is but i need to see miles. No way to look it up you have to get a calculator add it up and then figure out the mileage backwards. How stupid is that? I have to write miles on tax forms.

I can see how this app is very helpful if updated on a daily basis, or you have a need to track miles. I downloaded it so I could classify transactions from tax year 2019. It turns out categorizing a year's worth of transactions is basically untenable in the app. The only filter on loaded transactions is for ""suggested deductions"". No date filters, no text search on the loaded transactions, nothing. One filter, that ends up not finding anything because Stride didn't have any transactions to suggest. Okay, that's fine, I'll scroll through my transactions and flag them as I see them. Well, it becomes clear why they can't have the filter features pretty quickly. Maybe twenty transactions at at time are loaded when the user has scrolled through the previous twenty transactions. However, if I select a transaction, categorize it, and navigate back to the list of transactions, all of the transactions I scrolled through need to reload, twenty at a time, before I get back to oldest transaction I had just categorized. In other words, you always start scrolling at the top with your latest transaction first, even if these transactions had been previously loaded a few seconds prior. Okay, understood, maybe I just need fewer transactions to scroll through, so I'll connect fewer accounts. Well, this is borked too. Personal transactions were being loaded into my list of transactions when I hadn't connected those accounts. I don't know if that's Stride, Plaid, or my bank that I have business & personal accounts with, but without Stride providing any useful filtering capability and loading only twenty transactions at a time categorizing previous transactions is made very tedious. This issue was made EVEN WORSE because *duplicate* *personal* transactions were appearing in my transaction list. Like, I paid for Netflix once in one personal account I hadn't connected to Stride. Why am I scrolling past five Netflix transactions on the same date?? Terrible. I concede maybe due to privacy and security concerns caching transaction information increases Stride's exposure to data leaks of third party content, however the duplicative transactions combined with superfluous content amassed in drips by a stop-and-go endless scroll experience make categorizing past transactions with Stride a worse option than it was created to replace. This was my initial download because H&R Block is able to import transactions from Stride (apparently). Unfortunately, categorizing past transactions in Stride is more ardous than entering each transaction manually into the H&R Block interface. I'm a new user that was enthused about Stride's import capability with H&R Block that has been completely disappointed with Stride's utter disregard for categorizing any transaction that hasn't happened in the last few days. Besides this app being an blatant sales shell to Stride's other services, several fundamental features for classifying transactions are missing. Using a Pixel 2 with Android 10, I'm curious if the experience on an Apple product would be better. Without even a transaction web interface to compare with, I'm stuck presuming this is the best Stride can do. I can see how folks that expense a significant amount of car travel on a near-daily basis would find this useful. They probably would categorize their transactions daily too and wouldn't deal with having to scroll through a year's worth of transactions to categorize some of them. However, for any historical categorization over the course of a tax year on Stride's initial download, Stride is unequivically a failure. Two stars because the app probably works okay for some use cases. For my use case Stride is disappointingly useless. Fingers crossed I hear of improvements, but I'm not expecting any given it's clear Stride Tax prioritizes a bare bones beachhead of use cases to exist as marketing shell.";

We recently learned that a recent update to Android devices like yours is automatically disabling location tracking to save battery life, and that interferes with Stride's ability to track your miles properly. Just email us at taxhelp@stridehealth.com and we’ll help you adjust your phone’s settings so that your miles get tracked.

So far what I like the most is that it recognizes, somehow, when I'm on the road on my way to a client home or event.;
