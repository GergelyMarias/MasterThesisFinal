We are continuously working on optimizing the app, including the battery usage, but this case seems out of the ordinary.

Where I park my car on the drive it's still in range from my lounge. This means the last trip home doesn't always 'finish' and has to be manually stopped.

In my opinion (based on my business experience, take with a grain of salt) of the monthly cost was sub $10 I think it'd open the door to a far wider market.

Denmark";https://www.driversnote.com/privacy-policy;John Clark;2023.06.01;5;1;Before I purchased the App I used to manually record my business mileage. The iBeacon works really well and collects data I would normally forget to add like travelling to collect materials or site visits to do project estimates. I can sit back and let Drivers note do all the work. At the end of the Tax year, I can just run a report that will give me the total fuel costs for the year to enter into my tax return. Perfect 👌 The iBeacon is very accurate. I like the maps showing the A to B points;Thank you very much for your 5-star review!

My only complaint is that someone really dropped the ball with the pricing structure. Among all the cool bells and whistles rhat would make sense to charge for, they chose to charge for... spreadsheet space. Not a satisfying perk.

It seems to only go from a start and finish point, but when you've got multiple stop offs, it's just not feasible to enter them all. So I thought entering my mileage from the odometer would enable me to do this, but unless I'm missing something, it's just not allowing me to use the difference as a trip.;Hi Caroline, thank you for your review.

Denmark";https://www.driversnote.com/privacy-policy;A. Adrain;2022.05.27;2;18;Overall, a nice app. I found the lite version to be lacking as it limits you to 20 trips per month. If you only make 1 trip a day, then that is effectively only 10 days of use. Then the next step is almost $150 CAD per year. Quite a jump for a fledgling business. Coupled with auto tracking taking 2 hours to finalise a trip after stopping and/or having to manually enter trips or correct the auto tracking frequently, I find the app more of an imposition and less of an assistance.

Thank you for your review. An iBeacon may be a suboptimal solution if you are in close proximity to your car after you ended your trip. Perhaps motion-tracking could be a better solution for you. If you have any questions please reach out to us at support@driversnote.com

Looking forward to do my first tax return next year but so far I got all in the report which can be generated any time. Customer service is very prompt to respond and help. I've recomended to few people already because having the app you don't need an accountant. Regards;Hi Stefan. Thank you so much for your review and for recommending us. We really appreciate it!

I am sorry that the subscription cost came as a surprise to you.
We certainly don't try to hide the fact that there is a 20-trip per month reporting limit for the free version, with paid subscriptions available for users needing to report above that limit.
We put this information everywhere that Google allow us to.

Couldn't find a better one on the current market. Hope they come up with a better price plan for smaller businesses in the future though as I think it's still a bit steep. But customer support confirms me that they are still a small business themselves, which I can respect. Keep up the good work! Good luck 🤞;Thanks for your review, Yvette!

The app uses GPS tracking to log mileage, unfortunately trips can be off by a few Km eaxh time and this really adds up after 3 months. You can not make manual adjustments to individual trips or even manually log the odometer start and end reading, you can only enter a reading that is assigned to an unknown category which is useless for ATO reporting.;Thanks for your review and feedback, Peter.

I love how it saves locations I've put in and visually shows my routes. One bug I've noticed is when I'm looking at all of my trips, when I tap the month in the top left corner to switch months, it rarely works. Also, the ability to manually add recurring trips would be very useful, as many of us just go to and from the same place at the same time regularly. It would save battery life from GPS and time spent when in manual.;Hi Zachary, thanks for your feedback and review!

I have had a search around and no other apps do this.;Hi Ash, that's a really interesting idea - I've passed it on to our developers to take a look into. If you are looking for a simple way to link tracked trips to different companies/jobs, you can do that with Driversnote and the iBeacon - you just need to review trips and link them to the right job after they're tracked.

Denmark";https://www.driversnote.com/privacy-policy;Robert J. Kreckel (Bobby);2020.11.10;5;8;Works very well. I use it for when I'm working doing good deliveries. Does not record each stop by rather it works mapping you entire drive from initial starting point and final ending location, which works well for food delivery apps because as long as you're still punched in, all driving is recordable and can be used for your taxes. It has a nice layout and could use a few minor features but overall I really enjoy this app.;Hi Robert, thank you for providing such thorough feedback! We can also record each stop if needed, however, to automatically end your trip the app needs to detect no motion for a period of time - generally longer than a stop to make a delivery or pickup. So you'd need to manually stop tracking each time. Best regards & happy tracking :) Mihali

This is the only app that requires an additional item whwn it already has access to my location.;Hi Nick, I’m sorry to hear that you’re unhappy with our solution. We're certainly not the only app that requires a gadget to auto-track. The advantage of the iBeacon is that it allows us to know when you're in your vehicle, so we don't track your whereabouts all the time. We hope you find a suitable solution for your needs soon.

I totally understand that you would like the signup to be faster, but we have chosen to go without Facebook/social login because a lot of our users are concerned about privacy and since we don't need any of the social data that the social networks can provide along with your email and name.

Then it would work ok for a few days, then same problems. After 'force stopping app, it would give different mileage totals.  2017 was good, 2018 I am uninstalling... :/;"Hey Andrew! We're sorry that you had a bad experience with our app. We would really like to talk to you to find out more details about the problems you have experienced. It would be a big help if you would send us an email at info@driversnote.com, since we can't find you in our user database from your name. 
Thank you in advance :)"
