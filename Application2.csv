Jan 2024: It would be nice to be able to edit and add drives that the app has missed on the day that was missed, instead of me having to go to another page to input an additional missed drive and then having to figure out what day it was and what time I have to make up! I had 2 weeks worth of to and from work every day in September for unknown reasons, I had to input manually. So now I'm wondering how many other days have been missed!;"Hey Anne, Sorry for any confusion on the update, we wanted to inform anyone with drive detection issues.

Their reply was that they'd keep me informed of updates. Haven't heard anything and the reason being, nothing has changed. I can still drive I-10 from mile marker 302 non stop to Tuscon, mile marker 254 and it's still 5 trips. Guess that forces you to buy the premium package if you don't catch it. Didn't work, still not using the paid version.;Hey Richard! While we have updated the app, depending on the signals available, this can still occur. Drives can be joined via the app or the dashboard before classification to count as one trip. To help our investigation on this issue, please email us at reviews@mileiq.com with reference 789182

After blowing through several apps, and even paying for accounting software that claimed to do mileage tracking, this app has been the only one that accurately catches all of my trips and doesn't randomly shut off until I turn it off. Other apps have cost me months of lost trips and when it's deductible that's lost money. This is going to be very helpful at tax time. They just notified me of a potential issue and a link to update. THAT'S customer SERVICE.;Hey Callie! Wow we love to hear this! Thanks for the 5 stars!

A couple of days ago, my MileIQ stopped automatically tracking miles, without any change in settings on my end.

MileIQ uses cell and wifi signals rather than GPS which does delay initial location reading but should also not drain your battery. We also have a pause function in the Drive detection settings for times you do not want drives tracked. Please reach out to us at reviews@mileiq.com for a manager to continue assisting you!

Based on my vehicle's odometer readings, there is 76 miles more than the app recorded from 1 January to 31 December 2020. The app needs some minor adjustment. I would also like to see a receipt capture functionality added to capture fuel and maintenance costs in one place. Fix those issues and I would rate it 5 stars.;"My apologies for the experience that you have had with MileIQ. I would be happy to assist if you can email us at support@mileiq.com.

I paid monthly during that time due to the volume of trips. Both years, I found this app was missing about 2-3 thousand miles compared to the rideshare app (which, by necessity, must track mileage accurately to calculate fares and such). Also, I found MileIQ commonly split trips at random points, usually on highways, which made tracking mileage more difficult.

No refund and a full subscription for two weeks of service. I am retiring and have no use for the tracker, yet have to pay for unwanted service, Charge me for this month fine. Charge me for 11 unwanted months is a rip-off. Also the mileage rate is fixed (in Canada) at the CRA rate and cannot be changed if paid less, Otherwise the program worked well and was a lot easier than keeping a log book and remembering to enter trips.;

Only issue is that frequently at parking stops, the app thinks you've arrived and logs a different trip a minute later. There's got to be some 5-10 minute grace period that can be worked into the algorithm to stop this from happening. Yes, some traffic lights stop you longer than grace parking allowances.;Hi Elaine, thank you for the feedback! We apologize that MileIQ unintentionally split drives for you recently.

In the meantime, you can join drives together by tapping on the link icon between drives if they occurred in an hour or less between each other. You can delete drives if they are unclassified, and go to the Web Dashboard for all ese.

Custom categories, reports, reminders to categorize your drives. I love how Mile IQ notifies me so that I don't forget to classify my drives before I forget the purpose of the drive. I would love to have the option of being notified to categorize my drives once a day instead of after every segment. It is a bit annoying when I just stop for gas or run several errands a day. As it wouldn't be everyone's choice, the option setting would be great! Otherwise, it's the perfect mileage app.;Hi Julie, and thanks for the feedback. You'll be happy to know we have a lot of great new features on the roadmap this year. If you have additional suggestions we'd love to hear them. Please email reviews@mileiq.com. Thanks!
